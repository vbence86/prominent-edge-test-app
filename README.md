## Did you complete the project?
I have not completed the project due to unresolved issues with `ArcGIS Server REST API` `query` service. Although I have carefully studied the API documentation and attempted to send the right coordinates with the linked spatial reference number the service kept responding with zero results. After having invested around 1-2 hours to unpuzzle what parts of my requests had been incorrect and in spite of the working examples I turned my attention away from this section and focused on the rest of the test.

## How much time did you spend on the project?
I've spent 7 hours in total. 2 hours of unpacking the problem with the `ArcGIS Server` described above, 4 hours of implementation and 1 hour of wrapping up the project.
